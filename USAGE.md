# Usage Guide

## Quick Start

### 1. Initial Setup

1. Install the APK on your Android device (API 21+)
2. Launch the app
3. Configure backend URL in Settings section (default: `http://192.168.0.245:8080`)

### 2. Recording Your First Video

**Step 1: Start Recording**
- Tap the "Start Recording" button
- Grant screen capture permission when prompted
- If audio recording is enabled, grant microphone permission
- A notification will appear indicating recording is active

**Step 2: Perform Actions**
- Navigate through your device
- Open apps, demonstrate features, etc.
- Recording continues even if you minimize the app

**Step 3: Stop Recording**
- Return to the app (or open from notification)
- Tap "Stop Recording"
- Wait for the video to be saved
- Preview will appear automatically

### 3. Uploading Videos

**Step 1: Review Recording**
- Check the video preview to ensure quality
- Review metadata: duration, size, resolution
- Play the video to verify content

**Step 2: Upload to Server**
- Ensure backend API is accessible
- Tap "Upload to Server"
- Monitor progress with real-time statistics:
  - Upload percentage
  - Current speed (KB/s or MB/s)
  - Estimated time remaining
  - Bytes uploaded / total bytes

**Step 3: Wait for Completion**
- Upload completes when progress reaches 100%
- Success message displays with file ID
- Verify upload in MinIO bucket if needed

### 4. Handling Interruptions

**Scenario 1: App Minimized During Upload**
- Upload continues in background
- Return to app to view progress
- No action needed

**Scenario 2: Network Connection Lost**
- Upload automatically retries failed chunks
- Exponential backoff prevents server overload
- Progress resumes when connection restored

**Scenario 3: App Killed During Upload**
- Upload state saved to local storage
- Reopen app
- Navigate to "Pending Uploads" section
- Tap "Resume" on the pending task
- Upload continues from last completed chunk

**Scenario 4: Device Restarted**
- Same as Scenario 3
- Pending uploads persist across restarts
- Ensure recorded file still exists on device

### 5. Advanced Configuration

**Adjusting Recording Settings**

Edit `utils/config.js` to change default recording parameters:

```javascript
recording: {
  resolution: '1080p',    // Change to '480p', '720p', or '1080p'
  fps: 60,                // Increase frame rate for smoother video
  bitrate: 5000000,       // Increase bitrate for better quality (5 Mbps)
  withMic: false          // Disable audio recording
}
```

**Adjusting Upload Settings**

Optimize for your network conditions:

```javascript
upload: {
  chunkSize: 4 * 1024 * 1024,  // Reduce to 4MB for slower networks
  concurrency: 2,               // Reduce concurrent uploads for stability
  maxRetries: 10,               // Increase retries for unreliable networks
  retryDelayBase: 2000          // Increase base delay between retries
}
```

**Changing Backend Server**

In the app's Settings section or in `utils/config.js`:

```javascript
backend: {
  baseURL: 'http://your-server-ip:8080',
  endpoints: {
    init: '/api/uploads/init',
    status: '/api/uploads/status',
    complete: '/api/uploads/complete'
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Permission Denied

**Error**: "Screen capture permission denied"

**Solution**:
1. Tap "Start Recording" again
2. When permission dialog appears, tap "Start now"
3. Ensure "Don't show again" is NOT checked
4. If permission was previously denied, go to Settings > Apps > Screen Recorder > Permissions

### Problem: Recording Not Starting

**Error**: Recording status stays "Ready"

**Solution**:
1. Check Android version (requires API 21+)
2. Restart the app
3. Clear app cache and data
4. Reinstall the app if issue persists

### Problem: Upload Fails to Initialize

**Error**: "Init upload failed"

**Solution**:
1. Verify backend URL is correct
2. Check network connectivity
3. Ensure backend API is running
4. Test backend endpoint manually:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://192.168.0.245:8080/api/uploads/init \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"fileName":"test.mp4","fileSize":1000,"contentType":"video/mp4","bucket":"remote-consent"}'
   ```

### Problem: Upload Stalls at X%

**Error**: Progress bar stops moving

**Solution**:
1. Check network connection
2. Verify backend is still responding
3. Cancel and retry upload
4. If problem persists, check backend logs
5. Reduce concurrency in config

### Problem: Resume Doesn't Work

**Error**: Upload starts from 0% after resume

**Solution**:
1. Ensure file still exists on device
2. Check backend still has upload session
3. Verify fileId is correct
4. If backend session expired, delete pending task and re-upload

### Problem: Video Preview Not Playing

**Error**: Black screen in preview

**Solution**:
1. Check if file was saved correctly
2. Verify file size is > 0 bytes
3. Try playing file with external player
4. If file is corrupt, record again
5. Check storage permissions

### Problem: Low Quality Video

**Error**: Video is pixelated or laggy

**Solution**:
1. Increase resolution to 1080p
2. Increase bitrate to 5 Mbps or higher
3. Reduce frame rate if device is slow
4. Close background apps before recording
5. Ensure device has sufficient resources

## Performance Tips

### For Better Quality
- Use highest resolution device supports
- Increase bitrate (5-10 Mbps)
- Use 60 fps for smooth motion
- Ensure good lighting (for screen content)
- Close unnecessary apps

### For Smaller Files
- Use 480p resolution
- Reduce bitrate to 1-2 Mbps
- Use 24-30 fps
- Disable audio if not needed
- Limit recording duration

### For Faster Uploads
- Use Wi-Fi instead of mobile data
- Increase chunk concurrency (if stable network)
- Ensure backend is on same network
- Reduce chunk size for faster feedback
- Upload during off-peak hours

### For Better Stability
- Don't minimize app during recording
- Keep device plugged in for long recordings
- Ensure sufficient storage space (at least 2x video size)
- Close memory-intensive apps
- Use newer Android versions if possible

## Integration with Backend

### Verifying Backend Connection

Test the backend API is working:

```bash
# Test initialization
curl -X POST http://192.168.0.245:8080/api/uploads/init \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "fileName": "test.mp4",
    "fileSize": 1048576,
    "contentType": "video/mp4",
    "bucket": "remote-consent"
  }'

# Expected response:
# {
#   "uploadId": "...",
#   "fileId": "...",
#   "key": "..."
# }
```

### Verifying MinIO Access

Check the MinIO bucket:

```bash
# Using MinIO client (mc)
mc ls minio/remote-consent

# Or access MinIO console at:
# http://192.168.0.245:9000
```

### Viewing Uploaded Files

After successful upload:

1. Open MinIO console: `http://192.168.0.245:9000`
2. Login with credentials
3. Navigate to `remote-consent` bucket
4. Find uploaded file by key/fileId
5. Download or share link

**Q: How long can I record?**
A: Limited by available storage. 1 hour at 720p â‰ˆ 1-2 GB.

**Q: Can I edit videos in the app?**
A: No, this is a recording and upload tool only. Use external video editor.

**Q: Is there a maximum file size?**
A: No hard limit in app, but check backend/MinIO limits.

**Q: Can I upload multiple files simultaneously?**
A: Yes, each upload runs independently. Check device resources.

**Q: What happens if storage is full during recording?**
A: Recording stops and partial file may be saved. Check before recording.

**Q: Can I change video codec?**
A: Currently fixed to H.264. Modify native code to support other codecs.
